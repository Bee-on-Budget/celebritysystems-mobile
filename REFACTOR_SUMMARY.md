# Flutter App Refactoring Summary

## Problem Identified

The app had an execution order issue between the splash screen and login flow that caused critical data (specifically `companyId`) to be lost in certain scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Initial App Launch (Worker Role)
1. App starts → Splash Screen → Login Screen → User logs in → Navigates to Home Screen ✅

### Scenario 2: User Logs Out and Company Role Logs In (THE PROBLEM)
1. User logs out (clears token) → Login Screen → Company user logs in → **NO SPLASH SCREEN** → Directly navigates to Company Home Screen ❌
2. **Critical Issue**: The splash screen contains important logic to extract and save `companyId` from the JWT token
3. **Result**: `companyId` is never saved to SharedPreferences, causing the company home screen to fail

## Root Causes

1. **Login Bloc Listener bypasses splash screen logic** - It directly navigates to the appropriate home screen after successful login
2. **Splash screen logic is only executed on app startup**, not on subsequent logins
3. **Token parsing and data extraction logic is duplicated** between splash and login, but not consistently applied
4. **No centralized token data extraction** - Each flow had its own implementation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Centralized Token Data Extractor (`TokenDataExtractor`)

**File**: `lib/core/helpers/token_data_extractor.dart`

- **Purpose**: Centralizes all token parsing and data extraction logic
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates code duplication
  - Ensures consistent behavior across all flows
  - Easy to maintain and debug
  - Provides utility methods for token validation and data extraction

**Key Methods**:
- `extractAndSaveTokenData()` - Main method to extract and save token data
- `isTokenValid()` - Validates token expiration
- `getUserRole()` - Extracts user role from token
- `getCompanyId()` - Extracts company ID for company users

### 2. Refactored Splash Screen

**File**: `lib/features/splash/splash_page.dart`

- **Improvements**:
  - Better organized code structure with separate methods
  - Uses the centralized `TokenDataExtractor` utility
  - Enhanced error handling and logging
  - Cleaner navigation logic
  - Consistent with login flow

### 3. Refactored Login Bloc Listener

**File**: `lib/features/login/ui/widgets/login_bloc_listener.dart`

- **Improvements**:
  - Now uses the centralized `TokenDataExtractor` utility
  - Ensures token data extraction happens after every successful login
  - Better error handling with user-friendly dialogs
  - Consistent behavior with splash screen

### 4. Enhanced Main.dart Logging

**File**: `lib/main.dart`

- **Improvements**:
  - Added comprehensive logging for app initialization
  - Better tracking of token loading and user state
  - Easier debugging of the app flow

## How the Fix Works

### Before (Problematic Flow):
```
Company User Login → Login Success → Direct Navigation to Company Home → Missing companyId ❌
```

### After (Fixed Flow):
```
Company User Login → Login Success → Token Data Extraction (including companyId) → Navigation to Company Home ✅
```

## Key Benefits of the Refactor

1. **Consistent Behavior**: Both splash and login flows now use the same token extraction logic
2. **No Data Loss**: `companyId` is always extracted and saved after login
3. **Maintainable Code**: Centralized logic eliminates duplication
4. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
5. **Easier Debugging**: Enhanced logging throughout the flow
6. **Scalable**: Easy to add new token fields or modify extraction logic

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Fresh App Launch
- [ ] App starts with splash screen
- [ ] Token validation works correctly
- [ ] Navigation to appropriate screen based on role
- [ ] All token data is saved correctly

### Test Case 2: Logout and Re-login (Company User)
- [ ] User logs out successfully
- [ ] All data is cleared properly
- [ ] Company user can log in again
- [ ] `companyId` is extracted and saved correctly
- [ ] Navigation to company home screen works

### Test Case 3: Logout and Re-login (Worker User)
- [ ] User logs out successfully
- [ ] All data is cleared properly
- [ ] Worker user can log in again
- [ ] User data is extracted and saved correctly
- [ ] Navigation to worker home screen works

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/core/helpers/token_data_extractor.dart`** - New utility class
2. **`lib/features/splash/splash_page.dart`** - Refactored to use utility class
3. **`lib/features/login/ui/widgets/login_bloc_listener.dart`** - Refactored to use utility class
4. **`lib/main.dart`** - Enhanced logging

## Future Considerations

1. **Token Refresh**: Consider implementing automatic token refresh logic
2. **Offline Support**: Add offline token validation
3. **Security**: Consider encrypting sensitive token data in SharedPreferences
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for the `TokenDataExtractor` utility class

## Conclusion

This refactor successfully addresses the execution order issue by ensuring that critical token data extraction logic is always executed after login, regardless of the user's path through the app. The centralized approach eliminates code duplication and provides a more maintainable and robust solution.
